======================

Setup
-----

* Please refer to the manuscript, associated markdown files (.RMD), and scripts for detailed annotations of the datasets, analyses, and methods.  
* Recommended software tools: RSTUDIO Version 2023.03.1+446; R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)


Dataset descriptors
---------------

* Closure_dates.csv: a comma-delimited file containing the time of fishery closures on the Great Barrier Reef.
* csv.w00198.20220815123041.128.csv: Flood gauge data from the Fitzroy river
* IDCJAC0009_033260_1800_Data.csv: Rainfall data at the Keppel Islands
* g4.areaAvgTimeSeries.MODISA_L3m_NSST_8d_4km_R2019_0_sst.20020704-20220601.150E_23S_150E_23S.csv: Sea surface temperature data for the Great Keppel Islands
* GBR Plectropomus age samples_BMT.xlsx: Daily ageing of otoliths of Plectropomus maculatus collected at the Keppel Islands
* Plec_Sample data_Keppels_ KI3.2.xlsz: Juvenile Plectropomus maculatus collected at the Keppel Islands

Script descriptors
---------------

* The SpawningTimes_MS.RMD contains all text and scripts to reproduce the figures in the main text.
* The SpawningTimes_SI.RMD contains all text and scripts to reproduce the electronic supplementary material.

The following scripts follow a numerical order to process and analyse ageing and environmental data.
* SpT_00_packages.R: Loads required packages
* SpT_01_data_wrangle.R: Import and process ageing and collection data.
* SpT_10_est_growth_rate.R: Run GLMM to estimate growth rates.
* SpT_20_spawn_time.R: Estimate the time of hatch/spawn of juvenile P. maculatus collected at the Keppel Islands.
* SpT_21_wrangle enviro data.R: Import and process environment data (Rain, SST, Lunar, Flood).
* SpT_22_combine data for gam.R: Combine spawn time with environmental data for GAM analyses.
* SpT_30_GAM_spawning peaks.R: Run GAM for spawn time only to identify peaks in spawning.
* SpT_31_GAM_enviro.pred.R: Run GAM to test effect of environmental predictors on spawning patterns.
* SpT_32_GBM_enviro.pred.R: Runs a boosted regression to test effect of environmental predictors on spawning patterns.
* SpT_40_SeasonalClosures.R: Import and process fishery closure information. 
* SpT_41_SeasonalClosures glm.R: Run GLMM to test the effect of closures on spawning patterns.
